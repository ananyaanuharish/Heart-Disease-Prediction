# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🏥 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics using **Machine Learning**. The dataset used contains health-related attributes like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc. Various machine learning models are implemented to analyze patterns and provide predictions.

## 📌 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, feature selection).
- Implementation of multiple **ML algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.).
- Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics.
- Deployment-ready model using Flask (Optional).

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used is **Heart Disease UCI Dataset**.
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) / [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas` - Data Manipulation
  - `numpy` - Numerical Operations
  - `matplotlib & seaborn` - Data Visualization
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine Learning Models
  - `Flask` (for API - Optional)

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and normalization

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Feature importance analysis
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Decision Tree
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Performance Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC)
4. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Building a simple web app using Flask for predictions
